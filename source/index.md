This is a little side project about what I do at my employer Redpencil.
This way, it can double as an overview for colleauges and myself, as well as a source for me to put useful lessons I've learned or documents I've made or experiences I've had that go nowhere else. Writings about working at Redpencil and the technologies they use, documentation, accessibility, and maybe some gender and/or neurodivirgence, who knows.

Enjoy the show!
